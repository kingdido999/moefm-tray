This is a little [moe.fm](http://moe.fm/) radio app running on your system notification tray. It's cross-platform (OSX, Linux, Windows), I have built OSX and Linux versions successfully. I'd appreciate if someone would like to build it on Windows.

## Install

Make sure you have installed the latest version of node and npm. To upgrade node and npm,

For OSX/Linux:

```
sudo npm cache clean -f
sudo npm install -g npm
sudo npm install -g n
sudo n stable
```

For windows, you can download the latest version [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

Clone and cd into this repo, install packages and start the app:

```bash
npm install
npm start
```

## Shortcuts
